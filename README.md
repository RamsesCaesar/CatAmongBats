# Cat Among Bats
A retro-style pixel-art game where you kill bats as a cat.  
I originally made this game by following the [**ACTION-RPG TUTORIAL**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a) by the YouTuber [**HEARTBEAST**](https://www.youtube.com/c/uheartbeast) and now I'm developing the project further.
