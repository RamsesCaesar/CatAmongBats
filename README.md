# Cat Among Birds
A pixel-art game where you are a cat who hunts birds.

This game is a continuation and extension of the small game I made by following the [**ACTION-RPG TUTORIAL**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a) by the YouTuber [**HEARTBEAST**](https://www.youtube.com/c/uheartbeast). ([*Check out his GitHub*](https://github.com/uheartbeast/youtube-tutorials))<br>
The game is expected to be finished with version 1.0 in early 2023.
